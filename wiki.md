The **axolotl** is a *paedomorphic salamander* closely related to the *tiger salamander*.
 

Their name comes from **Xolotl**, the Aztec god of fire and lightning, who could take on the form of a salamander. Xolotl was also associated with *dogs*, and *atl* is the ancient Aztec word for *water*â€”so *axolotl* is sometimes translated as *water dog*.

The axolotl is quite unusual as they do not undergo **metamorphism** - process of change into mature form. They maintain their larval features, remaining gilled and entirely aquatic.


## Physical Characteristics

- black or mottled brown
    - varities with white skin and pink or red gills (as shown in picture above)
- few feathery, external gills on each side
    - provides oxygen

    - nonexistent when hatched, develop few weeks later

## Pokemon Representation
There are some pokemons that take inspiration from real life animals, and axolotl happens to be one of the inspiration. **Wooper** is a blue amphibious pokemon representing an upright, armless axolotl. The below picture shows Wooper's image.
